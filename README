What is it?
-------------
GoAccess is an open source real-time web log analyzer
and interactive viewer that runs in a terminal in *nix systems.
It provides fast and valuable HTTP statistics for system
administrators that require a visual server report on the fly.

Features
-------------------------------
GoAccess parses the specified web log file and
outputs the data to the X terminal. Features include:

 * General statistics, bandwidth, etc.
 * Time taken to serve the request (useful to track pages that are slowing down your site)
 * Metrics for cumulative, average and slowest running requests
 * Top visitors
 * Requested files & static files
 * 404 or Not Found
 * Hosts, Reverse DNS, IP Location
 * Operating Systems
 * Browsers and Spiders
 * Referring Sites & URLs
 * Keyphrases
 * Geo Location - Continent/Country/City
 * Visitors Time Distribution
 * HTTP Status Codes
 * Metrics per Virtual Host
 * Ability to output JSON and CSV
 * Tailor GoAccess to suit your own color taste/schemes
 * Incremental log processing
 * Support for large datasets + data persistence
 * Support for HTTP/2 & IPv6
 * and more...

Nearly all web log formats...

GoAccess allows any custom log format string.
Predefined options include, but not limited to:

 * Amazon CloudFront (Download Distribution).
 * AWS Elastic Load Balancing
 * Combined Log Format (XLF/ELF) Apache | Nginx
 * Common Log Format (CLF) Apache
 * Google Cloud Storage.
 * Apache virtual hosts

Why GoAccess?
-------------
The main idea behind GoAccess is being able to quickly analyze and view web
server statistics in real time without having to generate an HTML report (great
if you want to do a quick analysis of your access log via SSH).

Although it is possible to generate an HTML, JSON, CSV report, by default it
outputs to a terminal.

You can see it more of a monitor command tool than anything else.
